# Sentiment Analysis
Developed a sentiment analysis project using Amazon review data, where I extracted, cleaned, and
preprocessed the dataset to ensure quality, performed sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral), and
created a visually engaging word cloud to highlight sentiment-driven keywords, leveraging tools like Python
(Pandas, NLTK, Word Cloud) for data cleaning, text processing, and visualization
