# PROJECTS
## Sentiment Analysis
Developed a sentiment analysis project using Amazon review data, where I extracted, cleaned, and
preprocessed the dataset to ensure quality, performed sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral), and
created a visually engaging word cloud to highlight sentiment-driven keywords, leveraging tools like Python
(Pandas, NLTK, Word Cloud) for data cleaning, text processing, and visualization

## ChurnGuard Customer Retention Analysis
Developed a customer churn prediction project using telecom customer data, where I extracted, cleaned, and preprocessed the dataset to ensure data quality, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL and R to identify key churn patterns, and built a machine learning model in Python (Random Forest) to predict churn probability. Additionally, I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize churn trends, contract types, and high-risk customer segments, leveraging tools like Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn), SQL (SQLite), R (ggplot2), and Power BI for data analysis, predictive modeling, and data-driven storytelling.
